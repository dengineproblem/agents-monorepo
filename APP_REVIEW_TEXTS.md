## 6Ô∏è‚É£ `ads_management` ‚Äî Manage Ad Campaigns

```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ `Ads Management Standard Access` ‚Äî Standard API Access

### Tell us how your app uses this permission

```
Our app requests Ads Management Standard Access to increase API rate limits for serving users with large ad accounts and multiple campaigns.

Why Standard Access is necessary:

1. Multiple API Calls Per User Session:
   - Fetching 10+ campaigns simultaneously
   - Loading ad set breakdowns for each campaign (5-10 ad sets per campaign)
   - Retrieving individual ad performance (3-5 ads per ad set)
   - Historical data for 30+ days
   
   Total: 100+ API calls per user session

2. Real-Time Data Refresh:
   - Users expect up-to-date metrics
   - Dashboard refreshes data every 5-10 minutes
   - Multiple users accessing the platform simultaneously

3. Agency Use Case:
   - Marketing agencies manage 20+ client accounts
   - Each client has 5-10 active campaigns
   - Total API calls scale with number of clients

Without Standard Access, we would hit rate limits quickly, causing:
- Slow loading times
- Incomplete data
- Error messages
- Poor user experience

Standard Access ensures smooth, reliable operation for professional advertisers and agencies.
```

### Please provide step-by-step instructions

```
Standard Access is not a separate permission that requires UI demonstration. Instead, it's an access level that enables higher API rate limits.

To demonstrate why we need Standard Access:

1. Login at https://performanteaiagency.com/login
2. Complete Facebook connection
3. Dashboard loads - observe that data loads smoothly despite:
   - Multiple campaigns (10+)
   - Summary statistics requiring aggregation
   - Individual campaign metrics
   - Ad set breakdowns
   
4. Click on a campaign to view details
5. Campaign detail page loads quickly showing:
   - Campaign overview
   - Multiple ad sets (5+)
   - Individual ads under each ad set
   - Performance charts and graphs

6. Return to Dashboard
7. Click Date Range Picker
8. Select "Last 30 days"
9. Click "Apply"
10. All metrics refresh quickly without errors or timeouts

Without Standard Access, steps 3, 5, and 10 would fail or timeout due to rate limits.

Our app serves professional advertisers and agencies who need reliable, real-time access to their campaign data. Standard Access ensures we can provide this level of service.

Test Credentials:
Email: [insert your test user email]
Password: [insert test user password]

Note: Test account should have 10+ campaigns to demonstrate the need for higher API limits.
```
